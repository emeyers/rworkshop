## Part 1: R Markdown

R Markdown documents allow one to use a simple formatting syntax for authoring
HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents combined with R code. For more details on using
R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes
both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the
document.

### Part 1.1: Download files needed 


 Please press the green play arrow once to download the files. Once they are
 downloaded you do not need to run this again.



```{r download_files, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}


rworkshop::download_data("daily_bike_totals.rda")
rworkshop::download_data("profiles_revised.csv")
rworkshop::download_image("ProvidenceCollegeSeal.png")


```

### Part 1.2: R Markdown syntax - basics

In order to learn the syntax of R Markdown, there is a useful [cheat sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf).

### Part 1.3: R Markdown syntax - LaTeX

We can also LaTeX characters in the document, such as the Greek letter $\theta$,
and we can put accents on characters too such as $\hat{p}$ and $\hat{\theta}$.

### Part 1.4: Running R code

We can run R code inside of R chunks

```{r}

2 + 3

```

## Part 2: Data frames


Let's now continue learning R by looking at data frames. Data frames are
structured data and can also be thought of as collections of vectors.

Let's look at data from the [website okcupid](https://www.okcupid.com)


$\\$



### Part 2.1: Loading and viewing the okcupid data


```{r data_frames_1}

# read the data into a data frame
profiles <- read.csv("profiles_revised.csv")

# View(profiles)        # the View() function only works in R Studio!

# We can extract the columns of a data frame as vector objects using the $ symbol
the_ages <- profiles$age

# We can get the mean() age of OKCupid users
mean(the_ages)

```




$\\$


### Part 2.2: Extracting vectors from a data frame


We can extract rows from a data frame in a similar way as extracting values from a vector by using the square brackets

```{r data_frames_2}

profiles[1, ]  # returns the first row of the data frame

head(profiles[, 1])  # returns the first column of the data 

# we are using the head() function here so that we don't print out too much stuff!

# Note: the first column of the profiles data frame is the variable age, so we can also get the first column using:
head(profiles$age)  # this is the same as profiles[, 1]  


```





$\\$



### Part 2.3: Extracting vectors from a data frame using index vectors



We can also create vectors of numbers or Booleans specifying which rows we want to extract from a data frame

```{r data_frames_3}


# create a vector with the numbers 1, 10, 20
my_vec <- c(1, 10, 20)

# use my_vec to get the 1st, 10th, and 20th profile
small_profiles <- profiles[my_vec, ]


```






$\\$



### Part 2.4: Extracting vectors from a data frame using index vectors



Finally, we can also extract rows by creating a Boolean vector that is of the
same length as the number of rows in the data frame. True values will be
extracted from the data frame while false values will not.


```{r data_frames_4}

# create a vector of booleans
my_bools <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)

# use the Boolean vector to get the 1st and 3rd row 
my_bools <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)
small_profiles[my_bools, ]

# dim() gives us the the number of rows and columns in a data frame
dim(small_profiles)

dim(small_profiles[my_bools, ])

```
