## Overview


 * Multiple regression continued: Categorical variables and polynomial regression
 * Logistic regression
 * ANOVA



$\\$






## Part 1: Multiple regression with categorical predictors


Predictors in multiple regression can also be categorical. Let's explore this!



$\\$






## Part 1.1: visualzing salaries for different faculty ranks 


Let's examine how salary differs between professors of different ranks.



```{r plot_IPED}

# load the IPED data
load("IPED_salaries_2016.rda")


# create a data set with "Assistant", "Associate", "Full" professors
IPED_2 <- IPED_salaries |> 
  filter(endowment > 0) |>
  mutate(log_endowment = log10(endowment)) |>
  filter(CARNEGIE %in% c(15, 31)) |>
  filter(rank_name %in% c("Assistant", "Associate", "Full")) 



# visualize the data 




```





$\\$






### Part 1.2a: Fitting a linear model to the data


Let's now fit a linear regression model for total salary as a function of log endowment size, but use a separate y-intercept for each of the 3 faculty ranks (and use the same slope for all ranks). We can then use the `summary()` function to extract information about the model.



```{r lm_fit_offset}





```



**Questions:** 

How much of the total variability does the model explain? 

Are there differences between the Full Professors and the other ranks in terms of their intercepts? 

Also, how much less is an Assistant Professor making relative to a Full Professor?






$\\$








### Part 1.2b:  Visualizing the model fit

Let's recreate the scatter plot we created in part 3.2 using the same colors. Now, however, let's also add on the regression lines with different y-intercepts that you fit in part 3.3 (using the appropriate colors to match the colors of the points). 


```{r lm_offset_viz}

# recreate the scatter plot of the data with color indicating faculty rank






# extract the coefficients and plot separate regression lines for each faculty rank









# add a legend




```


**Question** Does using the same slope but different offsets seem to be adequate for capturing the trends in the data? 






$\\$







### Part 1.3a: Fitting models with different intercepts and slopes


Now let's fit a linear regression model for total salary as a function of log
endowment size, but use separate y-intercepts **and slopes** for each of the 3
faculty ranks.



```{r lm_fit_slopes}







```



$\\$



**Question**: How much of the total sum of squares of faculty salary is this model capturing? 




$\\$







### Part 1.3b: Visualizing the model 


Now let's again recreate the scatter plot you created in part 1.2 using the same
colors and let's add on the regression line with different y-intercepts and
slopes based on the model you fit in part 1.3a (again use the appropriate
colors).



```{r lm_viz_slopes}

# recreate the scatter plot of the data with color indicating faculty rank






# extract the coefficients and plot separate regression lines for each faculty rank






```

**Question** Does this model seem like a better fit and do you think there are
ways you could further improve on this model?






$\\$






### Part 1.4 Comparing models


The model you fit in Part 1.2 is nested within the model you fit in Part 1.3. We
can use the `anova()` function to compare such nested models. Does adding the
additional slopes for each rank seem to improve the model fit?



```{r anova_model_comparison}





```





$\\$





## Part 2: Multicolinearity and polynomial regression


Let's recreate the assistant professsor data frame for the next set of analyses.


```{r assistant_data}

# getting only data for assistant professors - ignore this for now and we will discuss this tomorrow
assistant_data <- IPED_salaries |>
  filter(endowment > 0,  rank_name == "Assistant") |>
  mutate(log_endowment = log10(endowment)) |>
  mutate(log_enroll = log10(enroll_total)) |>
  select(school, salary_tot, endowment, log_endowment, enroll_total, log_enroll, salary_men, salary_women) |>
  na.omit() |>    # get only the cases that do not have missing data
  arrange(endowment)

```


$\\$




### Part 2.1:  Multicolinearity

Multicolinearity occurs when multiple predictors are linearly related to each
other. Multicolinearity can make our parameter estimates unstable (i.e., it can
make it so that we have very large standard errors on our estimated regression
coefficients). We can detect multicolinearity using the `vif()` function from
the car package.

A VIF value greater than 5 indicates a relatively high degree of multicolinearity. 


```{r colinearity}








```







$\\$







### Part 2.2: Polynomial regression

We can also fit models that have non-linear transformations to our explanatory
variables. This allows us to fit a much broader range of models to our data. In
particular, we can fit models that are polynomial functions of our original
explanatory variables:

$y = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 \cdot x + \hat{\beta}_2 \cdot x^2 + ... + \hat{\beta}_k \cdot + x^k$

Let's fit the following model using the `poly()` function to create an
orthogonal polynomial expansion of the log endowment term and compare it to a
degree 1 model.

$\text{salary} = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 \cdot \text{log(endowment)} + \hat{\beta}_2 \cdot \text{log(endowment)}^2 + \hat{\beta}_2 \cdot + \text{log(endowment)}^3$




```{r poly_regression}


# refit our original degree 1 model




# fit a cubic model



# get statistics on our cubic fit



# compare the r^2





# we can visualize the fit too by predicting a sequence of points






```







$\\$








## Part 3: Logistic regression 



We can fit a logistic regression model using the `glm()` function. To fit a
logistic regression model, we will use the `family = "binomial"` argument. What
this function is doing is finding the "maximum likelihood" values for
$\hat{\beta}_0$ and $\hat{\beta}_1$.

We can use the coefficients from the model to build a function that can give the
probability of that the faculty rank is Full professor based on the salary
value:

$P(\text{Full professor} | \text{salary}) = \frac{e^{\hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 \cdot \text{salary}}}{1 + e^{\hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 \cdot \text{salary}}}$



```{r logistic_reg}


# get assistant and full professor salaries 
assistant_full_data <- IPED_salaries |>
  filter(endowment > 0, rank_name %in% c("Assistant", "Full")) |>
  select(school, salary_tot, endowment, enroll_total, rank_name) |>
  na.omit() |>
  mutate(log_endowment = log10(endowment)) |>
  mutate(rank_name = relevel(rank_name, "Assistant"))




# build the logistic regression function 




# extract the coefficients




# create the prediction function 




  

# what is the probability that if a school is paying $80,000 on average to a 
# particular faculty rank, this rank corresponds to the Full professor rank?
# (instead of the Assistant Professor rank)? 





```






$\\$







## Part 4: Analysis of Variance



### Part 4.1: One-way ANOVA

A college sophomore was interested in knowing whether the time of day affected
the speed at which he could download files from the Internet. To address this
question, he placed a file on a remote server and then proceeded to download it
at three different time periods of the day: 7AM,  5PM,  12AM. He downloaded the
file 48 times in all, 16 times at each time of day, and recorded the time in
seconds that the download took.

Let's assess whether the mean download time differs depending on the time of the
day! In particular we will assess:

$H_0: \mu_{7am} = \mu_{5pm} = \mu_{12am}$
$H_A: \mu_{i} \ne \mu_{j}$ for some pair of i, j



```{r download_speeds}


# get the data
download_speeds <- read.csv('downloading.csv', header = TRUE)





```







$\\$








### Part 4.2: Two-ANOVA


Let's use a two-way ANOVA to examine if ants are more attracted to particular
types of sandwiches! This is a balanced design because there are the same number
of observations at each factor level combination (in this case there are 4
observations at each factor combination level).


```{r ants}

library(Stat2Data)

data(SandwichAnts)


# Two-way interaction plot using base R




# Create a main effects only model (order doesn't matter in a balanced design)




# Could look at diagnostic plots




```







$\\$







### Part 4.3: Repeated measures ANOVA


In a repeated measures ANOVA, the same case/observational units are measured at
each factor level.

To run a repeated measures ANOVA, one gives each observational unit a unique ID,
and then one treats this ID as another factor in the analysis; i.e., one runs a
factorial analysis where one of the factors is the observational unit ID.

An advantage of repeated measures ANOVA is similar to the advantage to running a
paired samples t-test, namely it can reduce a lot of the between observational
unit variability making it easier to see effects that are present. In fact,
running a repeated measures ANOVA with a factor that only has two levels is
equivalent to running a paired samples t-test. Let's explore this using the
example of Freshman gaining weight from homework 4.


```{r freshmen}

# load the data
freshman <- read.table("freshman-15.txt", header = TRUE) %>%
  mutate(Subject = as.factor(Subject))


# independent sample t-test




# run a paired t-test testing H0: mu_diff = 0 vs. HA: mu_diff > 0, 
#   where mu_diff = mu_end_i - mu_start_i 




# let's transform to put it in a long format
freshman_long <- tidyr::pivot_longer(freshman, 
                                     cols = c("Initial.Weight", "Terminal.Weight"),
                                     names_to = "time_period", 
                                     values_to = "weight")



# let's run run a repeated measures ANOVA 
# we have the same p-value, and F = t^2




```







$\\$







### Part 4.4: Random/mixed effects models


In the example above, we treated each participant as a factor. However, we don't
really care about specific individuals in a study, but rather we care about an
underlying distribution that participants come from. We can model participants'
weight and being randomly sampled from an underlying distribution using a random
effects model.


```{r random_effects}

library(lme4)





```
