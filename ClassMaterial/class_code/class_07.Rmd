## Overview

 * Joining data frames
 * Spatial mapping
 * Reshaping data



$\\$







## Part 1: Joining data frames


Often data of interest is spread across multiple data frames that need to be
joined together into a single data frame for further analyses. We will explore
how to do this using dplyr.


Let's look at a very simple data set to explore joining data frames. 


```{r}

library(dplyr)


load('x_y_join.rda')

x
y



```





$\\$





### Part 1.1: Left join

Left joins keep all rows in the left table.  

Data from right table added when there is the key matches, otherwise NA as added. 

Try to do a left join of the data frames x and y using their keys.


```{r}




```






$\\$






### Part 1.2: Right join


Right joins keep all rows in the right table.  

Data from left table added when there is the key matches, otherwise NA as added. 

Try to do a right join of the data frames x and y using their keys.


```{r}




```





$\\$






### Part 1.3: Inner join


Inner joins only keep rows in which there are matches between the keys in both tables

Try to do an inner join of the data frames x and y using their keys.


```{r}





```





$\\$






### Part 1.4: Full join

Full joins keep all rows in both table.  

NAs are added where there are no matches.




```{r}




```





$\\$






### Part 1.5a: Duplicate keys


Duplicate keys are useful if there is a one-to-many relationship (duplicates are usually in the left table). 

Let's look at two other tables that have duplicate keys



```{r}

x2
y2

nrow(x2)
nrow(y2)


```






$\\$







### Part 1.5b: Duplicate keys


If both tables have duplicate keys you get all possible combinations (Cartesian product). This is almost always an error! Always check the output dimension after you join a table because even if there is not a syntax error you might not get the table you are expecting!


Try doing a left join on the data frames x2 and y2 using only their first keys (i.e., key1_x and key1_y). Save the joined data frame to an object called `x2_joined`. Note that `x2_joined` has more rows than the original `x2` data frame despite the fact that you did a left join!  This is due to duplicate keys in both x2 and y2. 

Usually a mistake was made when a data frame ends up having more rows after a left join. It is good to check how many rows a data frame has before and after a join to catch any possible errors. 



```{r}

# initial left data frame only has 3 rows



# left join when both the left and right tables have duplicate keys



# output now has more rows than the initial table


```






$\\$






### Part 1.5c: Duplicate keys



To deal with duplicate keys in both tables, we can join the tables **using multiple keys** 
in order to make sure that each row is uniquely specified.

Try doing a left join on the data frames x2 and y2 using both the keys. Save the
joined data frame to an object called `x2_joined_mult_keys`. Note that
`x2_joined_mult_keys` has the same number of rows as the original `x2` data
frame which is usually what we want when we do a left join.




```{r}


# initial left data frame only has 3 rows


# join the data frame using multiple keys



# output now only has 3 rows




```

## Part 2: Creating choropleth maps



To practice creating choropleth maps, we will examine demographic patterns in
the United States by creating a map of people who are of retirement age.

$\\$







### Part 2.1: Get map coordinates



To start our mapping practice, let's plot Yale's location (longitude = -72.9223, latitude = 41.3163) on a map of Connecticut.



```{r}


library(maps)
library(mapproj)


# Get the map of the States



# Plot a state







```





$\\$






### Part 2.2: Combine demographic data with the map coordinates


Let's now look at state demographic information and combine this with mapping data.



```{r}


# load the data
load("state_demographics.rda")


# mutate the data to names of states in lower case



# join state_demographics and states_map data frames 



# order the data



```






$\\$







### Part 2.3: Plot the map


To get a sense of which states have an older population, let's plot the number of people in each state who are over 64 years old. 



```{r}





```



**Question:**  What is wrong with this figure? 






$\\$







### Part 2.4: Normalizing data


In order to really see which states have older populations, we need to normalize our maps based on the total population. 

Do the results from the normalized map make more sense? 


```{r}








```






$\\$






## Part 3: Reshaping data


Creating plots and calculating particular statistics often requires data to be
in a particular format. Reshaping data is the processing of changing the number
of rows and columns of a data table in order to make particular computations or
plots easier. The tidyr package in R is package that is useful for reshaping
data. Let's explore it now!



$\\$




### Part 3.1: Simple reshaping


Let's start with the sample example that is in the class slides. The code below recreates this simple data frame. Let's reshape it by: 

1. Converting it into a longer format data frame using the `pivot_longer()` function. 

2. Converting it back to a wider data frame using the `pivot_wider()` function. 


```{r, simple_reshaping}


library(tidyr)


# the data example from the class slides
the_data <- data.frame(Person = c("Bob", "Alice", "Steve"),
                       Age = c(32, 24, 64), 
                       Height = c(72, 65, 70))



# convert it to a long format



# convert it back to wide format




```




$\\$






### Part 3.2: Reshaping data to create box plots of book prices


Let's examine the Amazon book price data to practice transforming data using
tidyr's `pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()` functions. The R chunk below loads
the data.

Let's start by using dplyr to create a simplified data set that only has the
columns `Title`, `ISBN.10`, `Amazon.Price`, and `List.Price`.


```{r}


# download the amazon data
# rworkshop::download_data("amazon-books.txt")

# load the book price data and removing NAs
amazon <- read.csv("amazon-books.txt", sep = "\t") |>
  filter(!is.na(NumPages)) |>
  filter(!is.na(List.Price)) 


# select only the Title, ISBN.10, Amazon.Price, List.Price variables
amazon_wide <- amazon |>
    select(Title, ISBN.10, Amazon.Price, List.Price) 


```





$\\$





### Part 3.3: Creating longer data

If we want to create a side-by-side box plot in ggplot we would need a data frame with the following columns:
  1. A column with the categorical variables saying if the price is Amazon's price or the List price
  2. A column with the prices

Let's transform the data to make it longer so that it has these columns using the `pivot_longer(df, cols)` function.


```{r}

# create a long data frame called amazon_long




# let's now create side-by-side boxplots on the long data




```





$\\$






### Part 3.4: Creating wider data again

We can convert data from a long format into a wide format using the tidyr R
function `pivot_wider(df, names_from, cols_from)`.

Let's transform our long data back to wide format. We could imagine a scenario
where this would be useful, for example if we wanted the difference in the
Amazon vs. List price and our data had come in the initial longer format, then
transforming to the wide format would be useful.


```{r}

# create a long data frame called amazon_long




# let's get the difference in prices and plot these differences in a single boxplot






```
