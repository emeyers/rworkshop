========================================================




In the following exercises we practice doing string manipulations and regular
expressions by using stringr library to translate the book Moby Dick back into
its original [Pig Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_Latin). The following
steps will walk to through the process of doing this conversion.

  
  



$\\$








```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, tidy=TRUE}
    library(knitr)
    # makes sure the code is wrapped to fit when it creats a pdf
    opts_chunk$set(tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=60))   
    set.seed(1)  # set the random number generator to always give the same sequence of random numbers
    library(stringr)  # use stringr for string manipulation
```







$\\$







**Step 1**: Load Moby Dick as a string into R 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, tidy=TRUE}

file_name <- '/home/shared/data_science_2018/moby_dick.txt'
the_book <- readChar(file_name, file.info(file_name)$size)


```





$\\$








**Step 2**: Get rid of one or more new line characters (\\n) and (\\r) also \\f.
Save the results to a new variable called the_book2.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, tidy=TRUE}



```







$\\$







**Step 3a**: Get rid of punctuation of the period (.) the comma (,), and the
semicolon (;)  - i.e., replace all their occurances with "".  Save the results
to a new variable called the_book3.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, tidy=TRUE}




```





$\\$







**Step 3b**: Also replace all occurances of the the em dash (—) with a space.
Note that em dash (—) is different from the regular dash (-) (hint: just to use
cut and paste the character here: — ). Save the results to an object the_book4.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, tidy=TRUE}





```









$\\$








**Step 4**: Convert the book from one long string, into a character vector that
has a separate word in each index in the vector. Save the results to a new
variable called moby_words. Hint: the str_split() function returns a list, so to
convert this list to a vector use the unlist() function).

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, tidy=TRUE}





```









$\\$









**Step 5**: Create a vector called vowel_inds that has TRUEs where ever there is
a vowel and a FALSE where ever ther is a consonant. Similarly create a vector
called consonant_inds that has TRUEs for words that start with consonants and
FALSEs for words that start with vowels.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, tidy=TRUE}




```








$\\$







**Step 6**: Let's first deal with the words that start with vowels. Add the
suffix "way" to the end of all words that start with a value. Hint: you should
use moby_words[vowel_inds] to get the words that start with a value, and also
you should assign the results back to moby_words[vowel_inds].

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, tidy=TRUE}




```






$\\$






**Step 7**: Let's now deal with the words that start with consonants. This will
take a few steps. First, create a vector called consonant_words that holds all
the words that start with consonants.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, tidy=TRUE}




```






$\\$







**Step 8**: Now create another vector called first_consonant_plus_ay that has
the first consonant from all the consonant words with a "ay" appended to the
end.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, tidy=TRUE}





```






$\\$







**Step 9**: Next create a vector consonant_words_no_first_letter that has all
the consonant words with the first letter removed.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, tidy=TRUE}





```





$\\$






**Step 10**: Now create an object called consonant_converted that concatenates
the words with the first letter missing to the words that have the first letter
plus "ay".

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, tidy=TRUE}





```






$\\$








**Step 11**: Next put these words back into the moby_words vector in the
appropriate place (hint: the consonant_inds vector will be useful here).

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, tidy=TRUE}




```







$\\$







**Step 12**: Finally concatenate all the words in the word vector back into one
big string. Hint: the collapse option to the str_c function will be helpful!

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, tidy=TRUE}





```





$\\$





**Step 13**: Now print out the first 500 characters of the book. Use the strwrap
function so that the output is all visible in the Markdown document. Is the
conversion perfect or is there something mission from the original document?

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, tidy=TRUE}



```
